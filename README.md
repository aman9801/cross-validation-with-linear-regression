# cross-validation-with-linear-regression

### Summary
This notebook demonstrates how to do cross-validation (CV) with linear regression as an example (it is heavily used in almost all modelling techniques such as decision trees, SVM etc.). We will mainly use sklearn to do cross-validation.

This notebook is divided into the following parts: 
- Experiments to understand overfitting
- Building a linear regression model without cross-validation
- Problems in the current approach
- Cross-validation: A quick recap
- Cross-validation in sklearn:
    - K-fold CV
    - Hyperparameter tuning using CV
    - Other CV schemes
